# Course 5: Deep Learning with PyTorch

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-deep-learning-with-pytorch?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course builds upon foundational deep learning concepts to explore advanced techniques using PyTorch. Learners dive into modern neural network architectures and methods to solve complex real-world tasks such as image classification, time series forecasting, and natural language processing.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand and implement convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and feature extraction.
- Build and train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including LSTM and GRU architectures, for sequential data.
- Apply transfer learning with pretrained models like ResNet and use fine-tuning for improved performance.
- Understand and implement common regularization techniques including batch normalization and dropout in deeper networks.
- Use PyTorchâ€™s modular tools (`torch.nn`, `torch.utils.data`, `torchvision`, `torchtext`) to build scalable training pipelines.
- Perform sequence modeling for tasks such as text generation and sentiment analysis.
- Visualize learned features and training metrics to interpret and debug model behavior.
