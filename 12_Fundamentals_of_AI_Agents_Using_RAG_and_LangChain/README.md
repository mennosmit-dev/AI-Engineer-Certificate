# Course 12: Fundamentals of AI Agents Using RAG and LangChain

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Fundamentals of AI Agents Using RAG and LangChain](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-ai-agents-using-rag-and-langchain?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to building AI agents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain. Learners explore the fundamentals of in-context learning, advanced prompt engineering, and the integration of RAG with LangChain to develop intelligent, context-aware applications.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply the fundamentals of in-context learning and advanced methods of prompt engineering to enhance prompt design.
- Utilize key LangChain concepts, tools, components, chat models, chains, and agents to build AI applications.
- Implement RAG using PyTorch and Hugging Face to retrieve information and generate responses for various applications.
- Develop applications using integrated LLM, LangChain, and RAG technologies.
