# Fundamentals of AI Agents Using RAG & LangChain – Project Implementations

This folder contains Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agent experiments 
developed during the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**.

The focus of this module was building context-aware LLM applications using LangChain, 
embedding-based retrieval, and modular agent workflows.

## 🧠 Overview

Key areas explored:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Prompt engineering and in-context learning
- LangChain chains, agents, and modular workflows
- Embedding-based retrieval with FAISS
- Practical AI agent design

These projects extend transformer fine-tuning and alignment work toward 
production-oriented LLM applications.
