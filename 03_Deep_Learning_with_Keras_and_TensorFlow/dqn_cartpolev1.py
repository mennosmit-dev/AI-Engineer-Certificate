""">>>Implemented a deep Q-Network in CartPole-v1, approximated Q-values via network(instead of table), 
trained network using memory, made a replay buffer. Scored a maximum of 43 steps without failure 
(+ ~400% compared to q_learning_agent_cartpole.py) due to more effective learning.

What is done in the code:
- Implementing a Deep Q-Network using Keras  
- Defining and training a neural network to approximate the Q-values  
- Evaluating the performance of the trained DQN agent

### Summary
These exercises are concise and focus on key modifications to the original DQN setup. The code snippets provided are short and simple, encouraging students to think critically about the modifications and how they impact the agent's performance.
### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a Deep Q-Network using Keras to solve the CartPole-v1 environment. You defined a neural network to approximate Q-values, implemented a replay buffer, trained the network using experiences stored in memory, and evaluated the performance of the trained agent. This hands-on exercise reinforced your understanding of DQNs and their implementation in Keras.
