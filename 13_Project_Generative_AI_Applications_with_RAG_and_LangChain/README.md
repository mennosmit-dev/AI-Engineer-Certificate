# Course 13: Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-generative-ai-applications-with-rag-and-langchain?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This project-based course provides hands-on experience in building real-world generative AI applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain. Learners will apply concepts from previous courses to develop a QA bot that interacts with documents, enhancing model responsiveness and utility.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Load documents from various sources using LangChain.
- Apply text-splitting techniques to enhance model responsiveness.
- Create and configure a vector database to store document embeddings.
- Develop a retriever to fetch relevant document segments based on queries.
- Set up a Gradio interface for model interaction.
- Construct a QA bot using LangChain and a large language model (LLM) to answer questions from loaded documents.
