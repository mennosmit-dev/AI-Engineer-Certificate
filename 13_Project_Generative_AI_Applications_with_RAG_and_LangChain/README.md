# Generative AI Applications with RAG & LangChain – Project Implementations

This folder contains applied generative AI systems built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
and LangChain during the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**.

The focus of this module was designing production-style LLM applications integrating 
document loaders, embeddings, vector databases, retrievers, and interactive interfaces.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Key areas explored:

- Document ingestion and preprocessing pipelines
- Text splitting and chunk optimization
- Embedding generation and vector database configuration
- Advanced retriever strategies (Multi-Query, Self-Query, Parent Document)
- RAG system integration with interactive UIs
- End-to-end QA application development

These projects represent applied LLM system design and real-world automation workflows.
