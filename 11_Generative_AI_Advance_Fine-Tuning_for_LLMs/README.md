# Course 11: Generative AI Advanced Fine-Tuning for LLMs

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Generative AI Advanced Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-advanced-fine-tuning-for-llms?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course delves into advanced techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), focusing on aligning models with specific business needs through human feedback and preference optimization. Learners gain hands-on experience with instruction-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning methods using Hugging Face tools.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Implement instruction-tuning and reward modeling using Hugging Face.
- Apply reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) techniques, including proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO).
- Utilize LLMs as policies for generating responses based on input text.
- Calculate rewards using human feedback and train models to optimize performance.
