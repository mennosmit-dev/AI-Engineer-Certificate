# **Building a Language Model Using Histogram N-Gram Analysis**

Estimated time needed: **60** minutes

This project introduces language modeling by focusing on generating 90s rap lyrics. You will implement histogram N-gram models using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to analyze and understand word frequencies and distributions. This approach helps reveal linguistic patterns and the rhythmic flow characteristic of 90s rap.

By leveraging these techniques, you will gain insights into how words are structured and distributed in text, laying a foundation for more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications

## Language modeling

Language modeling is a foundational concept within the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. It involves the prediction of the likelihood of a sequence of words within a given language. This method is statistical in nature and seeks to capture the patterns, structures, and relationships that exist between words in a given text corpus.

At its essence, a language model strives to comprehend the probabilities associated with sequences of words. This comprehension can be leveraged for a multitude of NLP tasks, including but not limited to text generation, machine translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.

Let's consider the following song lyrics to determine if you can generate similar output using a given word.

"""### Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

NLTK is indeed a widely-used open-source library in Python that is specifically designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, resources, and algorithms that aid in the analysis and manipulation of human language data.

### Tokenization

Tokenization, a fundamental concept within the realm of natural language processing (NLP), involves the intricate process of breaking down a body of text into discrete units known as tokens. These tokens can encompass words, phrases, sentences, or even individual characters, adapting based on the desired level of granularity for analysis. For the purpose of this project, you will focus on Word Tokenization, a prevalent technique. This technique treats each word in the text as an independent entity. Words, typically separated by spaces or punctuation marks, serve as the tokens in this approach. It's important to note that Word Tokenization exhibits versatile characteristics, including capitalization, symbols, and punctuation marks.

To achieve the goal, you will utilize the```word_tokenize```function. During this process, you will remove punctuation, symbols, and capital letters.
"""

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
def preprocess(words):
    tokens=word_tokenize(words)
    tokens=[preprocess_string(w)  for w in tokens]
    return [w.lower()  for w in tokens if len(w)!=0 or not(w in string.punctuation) ]

tokens=preprocess(song)

"""The outcome is a collection of tokens, wherein each element of the```tokens```pertains to the lyrics of the song, arranged in sequential order.

"""

tokens[0:10]

"""The frequency distribution of words in a sentence represents how often each word appears in that particular sentence. It provides a count of the occurrences of individual words, allowing you to understand which words are more common or frequent within the given sentence. Let's work with the following toy example:

```Text```: **I like dogs and I kinda like cats**

```Tokens```: **[I like, dogs, and, I, kinda, like, cats]**

The function```Count```will tally the occurrences of words in the input text.

$Count("I")=2$

$Count("like")= 2$

$Count("dogs")=1$

$Count("and")=1$

$Count("kinda")=1$

$Count("cats")=1$

$\text{Total words} =8$

Utilize```NLTK's FreqDist```to transform a frequency distribution of words. The outcome is a Python dictionary where the keys correspond to words, and the values indicate the frequency of each word's appearance. Please consider the provided example below.
"""

# Create a frequency distribution of words
fdist = nltk.FreqDist(tokens)
fdist

""" Plot the words with the top ten frequencies.

"""

plt.bar(list(fdist.keys())[0:10],list(fdist.values())[0:10])
plt.xlabel("Words")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

"""### Unigram model

An unigram model is a simple type of language model that considers each word in a sequence independently, without taking into account the previous words. In other words, it models the probability of each word occurring in the text, regardless of what came before it. Unigram models can be seen as a special case of n-gram models, where n is 1.

You can think that text follows patterns, and probabilities are used to measure how likely a sequence of words is. In a unigram model, each word is considered independent and doesn't rely on others. Let's calculate the probability of **'I like tiramisu but I love cheesecake more'**.

$  P(\text{"I"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"I"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{2}{8} = 0.250  $

$  P(\text{"like"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"like"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$  P(\text{"tiramisu"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"tiramisu"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$  P(\text{"but"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"but"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$  P(\text{"I"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"I"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{2}{8} = 0.250  $

$  P(\text{"love"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"love"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$  P(\text{"cheesecake"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"cheesecake"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$  P(\text{"more"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"more"})}{\text{Total words}}=\frac{1}{8} = 0.125  $

$P(\text{"I"}, \text{"like"}, \text{"tiramisu"}, \text{"but"}, \text{"I"}, \text{"love"}, \text{"cheesecake"}, \text{"more"}) = P(\text{"I"}) \cdot P(\text{"like"}) \cdot P(\text{"tiramisu"}) \cdot P(\text{"but"}) \cdot P(\text{"I"}) \cdot P(\text{"love"}) \cdot P(\text{"cheesecake"}) \cdot P(\text{"more"}) = 0.250 \times 0.125 \times 0.125 \times 0.125 \times 0.250 \times 0.125 \times 0.125 \times 0.125$

In general, language models boil down to predicting a sequence of length $t$: $P(W_t, W_{t-1}, ..., W_0)$. In this eight-word sequence, you have:

$P(W_7=\text{"more"}, W_6=\text{"cheesecake"}, W_5=\text{"love"}, W_4=\text{"I"}, W_3=\text{"but"}, W_2=\text{"tiramisu"}, W_1=\text{"like"}, W_0=\text{"I"})$

The subscript serves as a positional indicator in the sequence and does not impact the nature of $P(\bullet)$. When formally expressing the sequence, the last word is positioned at the leftmost side, gradually descending as you move through the sequence.

Using NLTK you can normalize the frequency values by dividing them by the total count of each word to get a probability function. Now you will find the probability of each word.
"""

#total count of each word
C=sum(fdist.values())
C

"""Find the probability of the word wish  i.w $P(strangers)$.

"""

fdist['strangers']/C

"""Also, find each individual word by converting the tokens to a set.

"""

vocabulary=set(tokens)

"""#### How unigram model predicts the next likely word

Let's consider a scenario from the above example **'I like tiramisu but I love cheesecake more'** where the unigram model is asked to predict the next word following the sequence **'I like'**.

If the highest probability among all words is **"I"** with a probability  0.25, then according to the model, the most likely next word after **'I like'** would be **'I'**. However, this prediction doesn't make sense at all. This highlights a significant limitation of the unigram model—it lacks context, and its predictions are entirely dependent on the word with the highest probability "I" in this case

Even if multiple words have the same highest probabilities, it will randomly choose any one word out of all the options.

### Bigram model

Bigrams represent pairs of consecutive words in the given phrase, i.e., $(w_{t-1},w_t)$. Consider the following words from your example: "I like dogs and I kinda like cats."

The correct sequence of bigrams is:

$(I, like)$

$(like, dogs)$

$(dogs, and)$

$(and, I)$

$(I, kinda)$

$(kinda, like)$

$(like, cats)$

**2-Gram models**: Bigram models use conditional probability. The probability of a word depends only on the previous word, i.e., the conditional probability $(W_{t}, W_{t-1})$ is used to predict the likelihood of word $(W_t)$ following word $W_{t-1}$ in a sequence. You can calculate the conditional probability for a bigram model using the following steps.

Perform the bigram word count for each bigram: $Count(W_{t-1}, W_{t})$

$Count(\text{I, like}) = 1$

$Count(\text{like, dogs}) = 1$

$Count(\text{dogs, and}) = 1$

$Count(\text{and, I}) = 1$

$Count(\text{I, kinda}) = 1$

$Count(\text{kinda, like}) = 1$

$Count(\text{like, cats}) = 1$

Now, let's calculate the conditional probability for each bigram in the form of $P(w_{t} | w_{t-1})$, where $w_{t-1}$ is the **context**, and the context size is one.

$P(\text{"like"} | \text{"I"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"I, like"})}{\text{Total count of "I"}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

$P(\text{"dogs"} | \text{"like"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"like, dogs"})}{\text{Total count of "like"}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

$:$

$P(\text{"like"} | \text{"kinda"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"kinda, like"})}{\text{Total count of "kinda"}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$

$P(\text{"cats"} | \text{"like"}) = \frac{\text{Count}(\text{"like, cats"})}{\text{Total count of "like"}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

These probabilities represent the likelihood of encountering the second word in a bigram, given the presence of the first word.

This approach is, in fact, an approximation used to determine the most likely word $W_t$, given the words $W_{t-1}, W_{t-2}, \ldots, W_1$ in the sequence.

$P(W_t | W_{t-1}, W_{t-2}, \ldots, W_1) \approx P(W_t | W_{t-1})$

The conditional probability $P(W_t | W_{t-1})$ signifies the likelihood of encountering the word $W_t$, based on the context provided by the preceding word $W_{t-1}$. By employing this approximation, simplify the modeling process by assuming that the occurrence of the current word is mainly influenced by the most recent word in the sequence. In general, you have the capability to identify the most likely word.

$\hat{W_t} = \arg\max_{W_t} \left( P(W_t | W_{t-1}) \right)$

Upon evaluation, observe that the result for $\hat{W}_1$ includes both "dogs" and "cats" with equal likelihood.

## Trigram model
For the given example sentence: 'I like dogs and I kinda like cats'

$ (I, like, dogs) $

$(like, dogs, and) $

$(dogs, and, I)$

$(and, I, kinda)$

$(I, kinda, like)$

$(kinda, like, cats)$

Trigram models incorporate conditional probability as well. The probability of a word depends on the two preceding words. The conditional probability $P(W_t | W_{t-2}, W_{t-1})$ is utilized to predict the likelihood of word $W_t$ following the two previous words in a sequence. The context is $W_{t-2}, W_{t-1}$ and is of length 2. Let's compute the conditional probability for each trigram:

Calculate the trigram frequencies for each trigram: $Count(W_{t-2}, W_{t-1}, W_t)$

### Trigram frequency counts

$ \text{Count(I, like, dogs)} = 1 $

$ \text{Count(like, dogs, and)} = 1 $

$\text{Count(dogs, and, I)} = 1$

$ \text{Count(and, I, kinda)} = 1$

$ \text{Count(I, kinda, like)} = 1 $

$ \text{Count(kinda, like, cats)} = 1 $

The conditional probability $ P(w_{t} | w_{t-1}, w_{t-2})$ where $w_{t-1}$ and $w_{t-2}$ form the context, and the context size is 2.

To better understand how this outperforms the bigram model, let's compute the conditional probabilities with the context "I like":

$\hat{W_2}=\arg\max{W_2} \left( P(W_2 | W_{1}=like,W_{0}=I)\right)$

and for the words "cats" and "dogs":

$ P("dogs" | "like", "I") = \frac{Count(I, like, dogs)}{Total \ count \ of \ "I", "like"} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 $

$ P("cats" | "like", "I") = \frac{Count(I, like, cats)}{Total \ count \ of \ "I", "like"} = 0$

These probabilities signify the likelihood of encountering the third word in a trigram. Notably, the result $\hat{W}_2$ is "dogs," which seems to align better with the sequence.

The trigrams function is provided by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. This function takes a sequence of tokens as input, returns an iterator over consecutive token triplets, generating trigrams, and converts them into a frequency distribution.

"""There are various challenges associated with Histogram-Based Methods, some of which are quite straightforward. For instance, when considering the case of having N words in your vocabulary, a Unigram model would entail $N$ bins, while a Bigram model would result in $N^2$ bins and so forth.

N-gram models also encounter limitations in terms of contextual understanding and their ability to capture intricate word relationships. For instance, let's consider the phrases `I hate dogs`, `I don’t like dogs`, and **don’t like** means **dislike**. Within this context, a histogram-based approach would fail to grasp the significance of the phrase **don’t like** means **dislike**, thereby missing out on the essential semantic relationship it encapsulates.
