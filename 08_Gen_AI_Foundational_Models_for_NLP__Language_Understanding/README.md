# Course 8: Gen AI Foundational Models for NLP & Language Understanding

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Gen AI Foundational Models for NLP & Language Understanding](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gen-ai-foundational-models-for-nlp-and-language-understanding?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to foundational models in natural language processing (NLP) and language understanding. Learners explore various techniques for text representation and model architectures used in NLP tasks.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain how to use one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, embedding, and embedding bags to convert words to features.
- Build and use Word2Vec models for contextual embedding.
- Build and train a simple language model with a neural network.
- Utilize N-gram and sequence-to-sequence models for document classification, text analysis, and sequence transformation.
