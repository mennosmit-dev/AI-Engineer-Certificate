# Course 9: Generative AI Language Modeling with Transformers

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Generative AI Language Modeling with Transformers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-language-modeling-with-transformers?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course provides an in-depth overview of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP). Learners explore both encoder and decoder architectures, focusing on their applications in tasks like text classification and language translation.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain attention mechanisms in transformers and their role in capturing contextual information.
- Describe language modeling using decoder-based models like GPT and encoder-based models like BERT.
- Implement positional encoding, masking, and attention mechanisms in PyTorch.
- Utilize transformer-based models for text classification and language translation tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents: The coding projects I worked on

- `attention_pos_encoding_models.py`: Experimented with attention mechanism for translation models and more general setups involing multi-head attention. Also experimented with several postitional encoding layers, and with Transformer Encoder and Decoder models, building a broad intuÃ¯tion around it. <br>

- `archive_classifier.py`: Rigorously build a transformer model to spit through large archives of documents and classify the documents under five distinct categories, scoring over 80% accuracy. The model consists of an embedding layer, positional encoding layer (tried several to see which worked best), and two sequential transformer encoders followed by linear layer.
