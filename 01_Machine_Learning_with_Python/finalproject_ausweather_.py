""">>>Final project: for a KAGGLE data set predicting wether there will be rainfall using random forest and logistic regression. This time random forest was slightly better (accuracy 83% over 81%). Doing this by feature engineering, a classifier pipeline with grid-search, performance measures and evaluations, different classifiers (updating the pipeline), hyperparameter tuning. Scored 16/20 points (80/100%) by AI evaluation system. Interested in the most important signals?

Consider the descriptions above for the columns in the data set. Are there any practical limitations to being able to predict whether it will rain tomorrow given the available data?

## Points to note - 1
List some of the features that would be inefficient in predicting tomorrow's rainfall. There will be a question in the quiz that follows based on this observation.

>ANSWER: yes, clearly we are not allowed to use forward-looking information which will amount to data leakage. So in practice we would need to keep the time-series aspect of the dataset in our minds, which is difficult here as we ommitted several observations which leaves the temporal order at risk. If we estimate the rainfall at a day using the features in the dataset crossectionally at a specific date then we use information we would not actually have which is a problem.
>ANSWER: >For example if there was rain today or tomorrow is something we dont know yet as it is part of what we try to predict. Also the MinTemp, MaxTemp, Sunshine, WindsGustDir etc. etc. are forward looking and unknown and can change during the day. Also, minTemp and Maxtemp depend on the full duration of the day and therefore we cannot use them as they are unavailable.

<details><summary>Click here for Hint</summary>
        
Consider features that rely on the entire duration of today for their evaluation.

If we adjust our approach and aim to predict todayâ€™s rainfall using historical weather data up to and including yesterday, then we can legitimately utilize all of the available features. This shift would be particularly useful for practical applications, such as deciding whether you will bike to work today.

With this new target, we should update the names of the rain columns accordingly to avoid confusion.

Would the weather patterns have the same predictability in vastly different locations in Australia? I would think not.  
The chance of rain in one location can be much higher than in another.
Using all of the locations requires a more complex model as it needs to adapt to local weather patterns.  
Let's see how many observations we have for each location, and see if we can reduce our attention to a smaller region.

## Location selection
You could do some research to group cities in the `Location` column by distance, which I've done for you behind the scenes.  
I found that Watsonia is only 15 km from Melbourne, and the Melbourne Airport is only 18 km from Melbourne.  
Let's group these three locations together and use only their weather data to build our localized prediction model.  
Because there might still be some slight variations in the weather patterns we'll keep `Location` as a categorical variable.

You could always gather more data if needed by partioning the data into similar locations or simplyby updating it from the source to include a larger time frame.

## Extracting a seasonality feature
Now consider the `Date` column. We expect the weather patterns to be seasonal, having different predictablitiy levels in winter and summer for example.  
There may be some variation with `Year` as well, but we'll leave that out for now.
Let's engineer a `Season` feature from `Date` and drop `Date` afterward, since it is most likely less informative than season.
An easy way to do this is to define a function that assigns seasons to given months, then use that function to transform the `Date` column.

## Try another model
#### Some thoughts.
In practice you would want to try out different models and even revisit the data analysis to improve
your model's performance. Maybe you can engineer better features, drop irrelevant or redundant ones, project your data onto a dimensional feature space, or impute missing values to be able to use more data. You can also try a larger set of parameters to define you search grid, or even engineer new features using cluster analysis. You can even include the clustering algorithm's hyperparameters in your search grid!

With Scikit-learn's powerful pipeline and GridSearchCV classes, this is easy to do in a few steps.

## Exercise 15. Update the pipeline and the parameter grid
Let's update the pipeline and the parameter grid and train a Logistic Regression model and compare the performance of the two models. You'll need to replace the clasifier with LogisticRegression. We have supplied the parameter grid for you.

# Define a new grid with Logistic Regression parameters
