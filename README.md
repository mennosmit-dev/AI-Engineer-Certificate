# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate – Project Repository

This repository contains selected projects completed during the **IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  
The focus of the program was hands-on development across machine learning, deep learning, transformers, reinforcement learning, and RAG-based AI systems.

The code in this repository reflects a learning environment and experimentation workflow.  
Some scripts are intentionally lightweight and focus on model concepts rather than full production structure.
