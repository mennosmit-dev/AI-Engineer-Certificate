# Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch – Project Implementations

This folder contains neural network implementations developed during the  
**IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**.

The focus of this module was building a strong PyTorch foundation, covering 
model construction, training workflows, optimization, and dataset handling 
using real-world classification tasks.

## 🧠 Overview

Key areas explored:

- Neural network fundamentals using PyTorch
- Optimization and training workflows
- Custom datasets and DataLoader pipelines
- Autograd mechanics and backpropagation
- Regularization and evaluation techniques

Several smaller lab-style experiments were completed to build intuition 
around tensors, gradients, and optimization; only the more applied 
implementations are highlighted below.
