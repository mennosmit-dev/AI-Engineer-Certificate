# Course 7: Generative AI and LLMs: Architecture and Data Preparation

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Generative AI and LLMs: Architecture and Data Preparation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-llm-architecture-data-preparation?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course introduces the foundational concepts of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), focusing on their architectures and data preparation techniques. Learners explore various generative AI models and understand the preprocessing steps essential for training LLMs.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Differentiate between generative AI architectures and models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models.
- Describe how LLMs, such as GPT, BERT, BART, and T5, are utilized in language processing tasks.
- Implement tokenization techniques to preprocess raw textual data using NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, BertTokenizer, and XLNetTokenizer.
- Create an NLP data loader using PyTorch to perform tokenization, numericalization, and padding of text data.
