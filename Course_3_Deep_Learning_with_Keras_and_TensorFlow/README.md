# Course 3: Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow** course, part of the **IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course provides an in-depth introduction to deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras. You will build, train, and evaluate deep learning models for various tasks, including image classification, time series forecasting, and natural language processing. The course emphasizes practical, hands-on experience using real-world datasets and models.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand key concepts behind neural networks, including perceptrons, activation functions, backpropagation, and optimization.
- Use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train deep learning models for both classification and regression problems.
- Develop Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data, with advanced techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, and pretrained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet).
- Build Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for sequential and time-series data.
- Apply embedding layers and pretrained word embeddings for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis.
- Utilize techniques like dropout, early stopping, batch normalization, and learning rate scheduling to optimize model training and performance.
- Implement models using the Sequential, Functional, and Model Subclassing APIs in Keras.
- Developing several GANs.
- Developing diffusion models.
- Implementing Q-learning and Deep Q-Network to solve reinforcement problems.
- (Prepare models for deployment by saving/loading, exporting, and understanding TensorFlow SavedModel format.)
