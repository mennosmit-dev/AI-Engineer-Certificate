- **MODEL YEAR** e.g. 2014
- **MAKE** e.g. VOLVO
- **MODEL** e.g. S60 AWD
- **VEHICLE CLASS** e.g. COMPACT
- **ENGINE SIZE** e.g. 3.0
- **CYLINDERS** e.g 6
- **TRANSMISSION** e.g. AS6
- **FUEL TYPE** e.g. Z
- **FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km)** e.g. 13.2
- **FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km)** e.g. 9.5

Analyzing a correlation matrix that displays the pairwise correlations between all features indicates the level of independence between them.

It also indicates how predictive each feature is of the target.

You want to eliminate any strong dependencies or correlations between features by selecting the best one from each correlated group.

"""

df.corr()

"""Look at the bottom row, which shows the correlation between each variable and the target, 'CO2EMISSIONS'. Each of these shows a fairly high level of correlation, each exceeding 85% in magnitude. Thus all of these features are good candidates.

Next, examine the correlations of the distinct pairs. 'ENGINESIZE' and 'CYLINDERS' are highly correlated, but 'ENGINESIZE' is more correlated with the target, so we can drop 'CYLINDERS'.

Similarly, each of the four fuel economy variables is highly correlated with each other. Since FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG is the most correlated with the target, you can drop the others: 'FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY,' 'FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY,' 'FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB.'

Notice that FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB and FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG are not perfectly correlated. They should be, though, because they measure the same property in different units. In practice, you would investigate why this is the case. You might find out that some or all of the data is not useable as is.

Regarding the non-linearity, you will handle this in the next lab. For now, let's just consider through modeling whether fuel economy explains some of the variances in the target as is.

You can transform your model's parameters back to the original space prior to standardization as follows. This gives you a proper sense of what they mean in terms of your original input features. Without these adjustments, the model's outputs would be tied to an abstract, transformed space that doesn’t align with the actual independent variables and the real-world problem you’re solving.

This is inconsistent with the 'best fit' hyperplane, which has a non-zero intercept of 329 g/km. The answer must be that the target variable does not have a very strong linear relationship to the dependent variables, and/or the data has outliers that are biasing the result. Outliers can be handled in preprocessing, or as you will learn about later in the course, by using regularization techniques. One or more of the variables might have a nonlinear relationship to the target. Or there may still be some colinearity amongst the input variables.
