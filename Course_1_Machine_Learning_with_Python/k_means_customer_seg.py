Comment on the within-cluster sum of squares, i.e. inertia, of the clusters created for k=3 and k=5.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>
For k=3, the value of within-cluster sum of squares will be higher that that for k=4, since the points from different natural clusters are being grouped together, leading to underfitting of the k-means model. For k=5, the value of will be lesser than that for k=4, since the points are distributed into mode clusters than needed, leading to over-fitting of the k-means model.

<h1 id="customer_segmentation_K_means">Customer Segmentation with k-means</h1>

Imagine that you have a customer dataset, and you need to apply customer segmentation to this historical data.
Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, or more likely to purchase products, or subscribe to a service. A business task is to retain those customers.

#### Normalizing over the standard deviation
Now let's normalize the dataset. But why do we need normalization in the first place? Normalization is a statistical method that helps mathematical-based algorithms to interpret features with different magnitudes and distributions equally, tranforming the features so they have zero mean and standard deviation of one. We use `StandardScaler()` to normalize, or standardize our dataset.
