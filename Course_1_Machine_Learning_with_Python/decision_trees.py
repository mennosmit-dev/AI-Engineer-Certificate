"""### About the dataset
Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X and Drug Y.

Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are the Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

It is a sample of a multiclass classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of an unknown patient or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

"""## Data Analysis and pre-processing
You should apply some basic analytics steps to understand the data better. First, let us gather some basic information about the dataset.

"""

my_data.info()

"""This tells us that 4 out of the 6 features of this dataset are categorical, which will have to be converted into numerical ones to be used for modeling. For this, we can make use of __LabelEncoder__ from the Scikit-Learn library.

"""

my_data['BP'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(my_data['BP'])
my_data['Cholesterol'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(my_data['Cholesterol'])

"""With this, you now have 5 parameters that can be used for modeling and 1 feature as the target variable.
We can see from comparison of the data before Label encoding and after it, to note the following mapping.
<br>
For parameter 'Sex' : $M \rightarrow 1, F \rightarrow 0$ <br>
For parameter 'BP' : $High \rightarrow 0, Low \rightarrow 1, Normal \rightarrow 2$<br>
For parameter 'Cholesterol' : $High \rightarrow 0, Normal \rightarrow 1$

You can also check if there are any missing values in the dataset.
"""

my_data.isnull().sum()

To evaluate the correlation of the target variable with the input features, it will be convenient to map the different drugs to a numerical value. Execute the following cell to achieve the same.

Write the code to find the correlation of the input variables with the target variable and identify the features most significantly affecting the target.

```python
my_data.drop('Drug',axis=1).corr()['Drug_num']

"""This shows us the distribution of the different classes, clearly indicating that Drug X and Drug Y have many more records in comparison to the other 3.

## Modeling

For modeling this dataset with a Decision tree classifier, we first split the dataset into training and testing subsets. For this, we separate the target variable from the input variables.
"""

y = my_data['Drug']
X = my_data.drop(['Drug','Drug_num'], axis=1)

"""Now, use the __train_test_split()__ function to separate the training data from the testing data. We can make use of 30% of the data for testing and the rest for training the Decision tree.

"""You can now define the Decision tree classifier as __drugTree__ and train it with the training data.

"""

drugTree = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy", max_depth = 4)

drugTree.fit(X_trainset,y_trainset)

"""### Evaluation

Now that you have trained the decision tree, we can use it to generate the predictions on the test set.
"""

tree_predictions = drugTree.predict(X_testset)

"""We can now check the accuracy of our model by using the accuracy metric.

"""

print("Decision Trees's Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_testset, tree_predictions))

"""This means that the model was able to correctly identify the labels of 98.33%, i.e. 59 out of 60 test samples.

### Visualize the tree

To understand the classification criteria derived by the Decision Tree, we may generate the tree plot.
"""

plot_tree(drugTree)
plt.show()

"""From this tree, we can derive the criteria developed by the model to identify the class of each training sample. We can interpret them by tracing the criteria defined by tracing down from the root to the tree's leaf nodes.

For instance, the decision criterion for Drug Y is ${Na\_to\_K} \gt 14.627$.

#### Practice Question:
Along similar lines, identify the decision criteria for all other classes.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>
Drug A : $Na\_to\_K <= 14.627, BP = High, Age <= 50.5$<br>
Drug B : $Na\_to\_K <= 14.627, BP = High, Age > 50.5$ <br>
Drug C : $Na\_to\_K <= 14.627, BP = Normal, Cholesterol = High$<br>
Drug X : $Na\_to\_K <= 14.627, (BP = Low, Cholesterol = High) or (BP = Normal/Low, Cholesterol = Normal)$

#### Practice Question:

If the max depth of the tree is reduced to 3, how would the performance of the model be affected?
