# Course 1: Machine Learning with Python

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This course introduces the foundations of machine learning using Python, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Learners explore algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and recommender systems while applying them using real-world data and libraries like Scikit-learn.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply supervised learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM).
- Implement unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
- Build a basic recommender system using collaborative filtering.
- Evaluate models using various performance metrics.
- Use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to build and evaluate ML models.
