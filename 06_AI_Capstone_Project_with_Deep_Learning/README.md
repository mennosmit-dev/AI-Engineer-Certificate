# Course 6: AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning

This folder contains coursework and projects completed for the **[AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-deep-learning-capstone?specialization=ai-engineer)** course, part of the [IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Description

This capstone course allows learners to apply the skills acquired throughout the IBM AI Engineering Certificate to a real-world deep learning problem. It focuses on the full development pipeline, including data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and presentation.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Define a deep learning project goal and select a suitable problem scope.
- Collect, clean, and preprocess data for training deep neural networks.
- Design and implement an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using PyTorch or Keras.
- Apply advanced architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and transfer learning depending on the task (e.g., image classification or NLP).
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and performance visualizations.
- Apply techniques like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and data augmentation to improve model performance.
- Document the project thoroughly and communicate the solution clearly with stakeholders.
