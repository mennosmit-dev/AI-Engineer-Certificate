# AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning – Project Implementations

This folder contains the capstone project developed during the  
**IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**.

The goal of this module was to apply deep learning concepts in an end-to-end workflow, 
covering data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and presentation.

## 🧠 Overview

Key areas explored:

- End-to-end deep learning pipeline design
- Transfer learning with pretrained architectures
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

Smaller lab-style exercises focused on data loading and preparation are included, 
while the main applied project is highlighted below.

## 📂 Project

### 🔹 Concrete Crack Detection – ResNet50

- `concrete_resnet50.py`  
  Fine-tuned a **ResNet50** architecture to detect structural cracks in concrete surfaces.  
  Focused on transfer learning, preprocessing workflows, and model evaluation for a real-world computer vision task.
